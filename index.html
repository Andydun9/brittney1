    <p>Ohhhh! Brittney Brittney Brittney and Daniel,</p>

    <p> Do you remember that night that we all went out for Daniel’s birthday. It started as a fun night... we went to Top
        Golf played games and drank. Shortly after that we went back to your house and from there we Ubered
        to the Hub. At the Hub we were continuing to have fun and listen to Karaoke. Then at some point Brittney and
        Daniel thought it would be fun to make Jessica and I sing a duet together. Without even mentioning it you two
        signed us up to do karaoke.</p>

    <p>I remember as I stepped out of the bathroom all of a sudden, I here the DJ say, “for our next
        song we have Andy and Jess singing Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond”. Not prepared for a song that I don’t know
        half of the lyrics too, both of us mumbled our way through the song. Oh I can't forget to mention that the
        bar was packed.</p>

    <p>The next day I get a text message from Jess, and she tells me that I need to watch your Snap Chat story, and
        that you had posted a video of us singing. So at this point both of us had decided that it was on like Donkey
        Kong!</p>

    <p>So here is your new website that is dedicated to our favorite friends!!!</p>

    <p>Love,
        <br>
        Andy and Jess</p>
