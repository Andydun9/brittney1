            <p>Ohhhh! Brittney Brittney Brittney and Daniel,</p>

            <p> Do you remember that night that we all went out for Daniel’s birthday. It started as a fun night... we
                went
                to
                Top
                Golf played games and drank. Shortly after that we went back to your house and from there we Ubered
                to the Hub. At the Hub we were continuing to have fun and listen to Karaoke. Then at some point Brittney
                and
                Daniel thought it would be funny to make Jessica and I sing a duet together. Without even mentioning it
                you
                two
                signed us up to sing karaoke.</p>

            <p>I remember as I stepped out of the bathroom all of a sudden, I here the DJ say, “for our next
                song we have Andy and Jess singing Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond”. Not prepared for a song that I don’t
                know
                half of the lyrics too, both of us mumbled our way through the song. Oh I can't forget to mention that
                the
                bar was packed!</p>

            <p>The next day I get a text message from Jess, and she tells me that I need to watch your Snap Chat story,
                and
                that you had posted a video of us singing. So at this point both of us had decided that it was on like
                Donkey
                Kong!</p>

            <p>So here is your new website that is dedicated to our favorite friends!!!</p>

            <p>Love,
                <br>
                Andy and Jess</p>
